<h2 id="overview">Overview <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">↥</a></h2>
<p>
    If you are working on an image for another project and need to check
    how it's looking in situ frequently, Krita's native export workflow
    can slow you down. While it only takes a few seconds each time, these
    can add up. You may find yourself exporting less often because of the
    friction involved in doing so, and the result may suffer for it.
</p><p>
    The Quick Export plugin provides a set and forget workflow. The first
    time you go to export your image, you'll first choose where to save
    it, what type it will be, and the export settings for that type. From
    then on, your image will export immediately.
</p><p>
    Quick Export also supports <a href="#versions-options">file versions</a> as produced when you use
    Krita's save incremental version feature, so you can use the same
    settings for the duration of a project. For example, the settings for
    "file.kra" can automatically apply to "file_001.kra", "file_002.kra", 
    and so on.
</p><p>
    You can add the Quick Export and Quick Export Configuration action
    buttons to your toolbar from Settings → Configure Toolbars, and you can
    assign shortcuts (eg. Alt+E) from Settings → Configure Krita → Keyboard Shortcuts → Menu → File.
</p>
<h2 id="faq">Configuration Dialog</h2>
<h3 id="faq/quickstart">How do I setup an image for use with this plugin? <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">↥</a></h3>
<p>
    First make sure the image is saved. Then press Quick Export in the
    file menu or toolbar. In the dialog, choose an export name, type and
    settings. Close the dialog. Now when this is the active image in Krita
    and you press Quick Export, the image will be exported.
</p>
<h3 id="faq/missing-in-dialog">Why does my image not appear in the dialog? <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">↥</a></h3>
<p>
    First, have you saved your image? Quick Export ignores unsaved images.
</p><p>
    Second, has it been filtered out? Enable show non-kra and show unopened
    (and show unstored if in Advanced mode). If the image file isn't currently
    open in Krita, check that it hasn't been moved to a different folder or
    name. Open it in Krita then look in the dialog again: is it there?
</p><p>
    Perhaps its export settings had not been saved in the plugin. Remember to change
    one of its settings or export it with the export now button, or check the store
    settings checkbox directly (if in Advanced mode). If that checkbox isn't
    checked, the plugin will not save settings for this image (and will forget
    settings already saved, if any). By default, if the row is highlighted
    in blue, it will be saved.
</p>
<h3 id="faq/bad-export">Why has my image not exported correctly? <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">↥</a></h3>
<p>
    If you've double checked your export settings and the image still comes
    out wrong, you should first try exporting again with the same settings
    using Krita's normal export workflow.
</p><p>
    Does Krita export the image wrongly too? If so, that may be a bug
    in Krita. See if updating to a later version of Krita helps. If not,
    consider filing a bug report on Krita's bug tracker.
</p><p>
    Does Krita export the image correctly? If so, that may be a bug in
    the plugin. Check if a more recent version of the plugin is available.
    If not, consider filing a bug report on the plugins bug tracker.
</p><p>
    Note that ultimately the plugins export capabilities are constrained
    by what Krita's API makes available to it. Fixes for some plugin issues
    may depend on changes to Krita's API.
</p>
<h3 id="faq/versions">How can I use the same settings for multiple versions of an image? <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">↥</a></h3>
<p>
    In the configuration dialog, on that image's row, set versions options
    to "this and later versions of this file". See <a href=#versions-options>versions options.</a>
</p><p>
    To work, your images should follow the same naming convention as used
    by Krita's "save incremental version" action.
</p><p>
    The version number must always be a series of digits following an
    underscore after the base name and before the extension. It can not
    be at the start of the name, in the middle, or after the extension.
    It can not contain any non-numeric characters.
</p><p>
    <tt>"MyPic.kra"</tt>, <tt>"MyPic_0.kra"</tt>, <tt>"MyPic_000.kra"</tt> are examples
    of acceptable names for the "base" version (or version 0) of the image <tt>"MyPic"</tt>.
</p><p>
    <tt>"MyPic_1.kra"</tt>, <tt>"MyPic_01.kra"</tt>, and <tt>"MyPic_001.kra"</tt> are
    examples of acceptable names for version one of that image.
</p><p>
    <tt>"MyPic1.kra"</tt> or <tt>"MyPic01.kra"</tt> are not acceptable names for
    version one of that image; they would instead be interpreted as the
    "base" version (or version 0) of the images <tt>"MyPic1"</tt>  and <tt>"MyPic01"</tt>,
    respectively.
</p>
<h3 id="faq/row-confusion">Why does my image not have the settings I previously set in the dialog? <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">↥</a></h3>
<p>
    You might be looking at the wrong row. Every currently open document
    has a row of its own in the dialog, but in addition to that, a document
    that is a version of an image will "inherit" the settings of that
    image (provided that image's settings are set to apply to its versions).
</p><p>
    For example: settings are stored for "Image.kra", and its
    versioning options are set to "versions of this file". Now we open the
    dialog for "Image_001.kra". There will be a row for "Image_001.kra",
    but the settings that are actually used when you export the document
    from the file menu or toolbar are the settings for "Image.kra", because
    it it set to apply to versions of it, and "Image_001.kra" is one. So
    to change the export settings for "Image_001.kra", you should change
    the export settings for "Image.kra".
</p>
<h3 id="faq/q">Question <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">↥</a></h3>
<p>
    Answer.
</p>
<h2 id="configuration-dialog">Configuration Dialog</h2>
<h3 id="configuration-dialog/settings-rows">Settings rows <a class="back-to-top" href="#contents">↥</a></h3>
<p>
    Each row in the dialog represents a file, one for each file currently
    open in Krita, plus those not currently open but for which export settings
    have previously been saved.
</p><p>
    When you open the dialog, it will scroll to show the row with the
    settings that apply to the active document.
</p><p>
    From left to right, the contents of a row are as follows:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt id="store-settings-checkbox">Store settings checkbox</dt>
    <dd>
        Indicates that these settings will be saved. If you no longer
        need to export an image, you can uncheck this and Quick Export
        will forget about it. Remember that this won't happen until
        you save your changes. (<a href="#advanced-mode">Advanced mode</a> only.)
    </dd>
    <dt>Open file button</dt>
    <dd>
        Press this button to open a currently unopened file. An asterisk
        will show here for the file that was active in Krita when the
        dialog opened. Otherwise this space is blank.
    </dd>
    <dt>Source file path and name</dt>
    <dd>
        The folder and file name with extension for the image to export
        from.
    </dd>
    <dt id="versions-options">Versions options</dt>
    <dd>
        Here you can choose which files these settings apply to.
        <dl>
            <dt>This exact file</dt>
            <dd>
                Settings apply to the specified source file alone. Versions
                of this image are ignored.
            </dd>
            <dt>Versions of this file</dt>
            <dd>
                Settings apply to the specified source file and any file
                in the same directory with the same name plus an
                underscore and one or more digits (and the same file
                extension). For example, settings for "file.kra" will
                also apply to "file_001.kra", "file_002.kra", etc. If the
                source file name already has a version number (even if
                it's "_000"), you probably want to use the next option;
                "file_000.kra" would be considered the base for version
                files named "file_000_001.kra", "file_000_002.kra", etc.
            </dd>
            <dt>This and later versions of this file</dt>
            <dd>
                Settings apply to the specified source file and any version
                of that file in the same directory with a greater version
                number. For example, settings for "file_005.kra" will also
                apply to "file_006.kra" and "file_007.kra", but not to
                "file_004.kra" or "file.kra". Use this option if you name
                the first version of your image with a version number, or
                wish to change export settings part way through a project
                but also keep the old settings for earlier versions.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        Most of the time, use option 3 (this and later versions).
        <br/>
        Press the arrow button to show a list of all the files that
        the settings on this row apply to.
    </dd>
    <dt>Export file path button</dt>
    <dd>
        Click this to open a file dialog where you can choose the
        folder and name to export to. When you are exporting to
        the same folder as the source, this will show as a dot.
    </dd>
    <dt>Export file name</dt>
    <dd>
        You can also set the name to export to here. Note that when
        the settings on this row apply to multiple versions of the
        image, exporting from any of them will overwrite this file.
        That is, exported files are unversioned (eg. "file.kra",
        "file_001.kra", "file_002.kra" etc. will all export to
        "file.png", not "file.png", "file_001.png", "file_002.png",
        etc.)
    </dd>
    <dt id="export-file-type">Export file type</dt>
    <dd>
        This dropdown lists all supported file types. Select which
        type you wish to export to. Note that by default, only the
        most commonly used types are shown; see <a href="#visible-file-types">Visible file types</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>Export settings</dt>
    <dd>
        The settings shown here depends on the export file type you've
        chosen. Each setting has a tooltip containing information about
        what it does.
    </dd>
    <dt>Export now button</dt>
    <dd>
        You can export an image at any time directly from the dialog
        (provided it is open in Krita). For rows applying to multiple
        currently open images, this button shows a menu where you can
        select the one to export.

        Non-kra: Typically you will work in and export from Krita
        project files (.kra), so this option lets you hide images of
        other types.
        </dd><dd>
        Unopened: By default the list will contain every file for which
        export settings are stored, including those not currently open in
        Krita. This option lets you hide those.
        </dd><dd id="show-unstored">
        Unstored (Advanced mode only): By default the list will contain
        every file currently opened in Krita (excluding unsaved images),
        including those for which no export settings are currently stored.
        Once you have set up export settings for the images you want to

        be accessed as a popup by pressing the button in the settings column.
        </dd><dd>
        Compact: Every row will be as short as it can be while still showing
        all settings for the chosen image type. Settings will appear as
        buttons without labels, but you can still see information about
        them in their tooltips.
        </dd><dd>
        Focused: Every row will be compact or minimized, except for a
        "focused" row which will appear expanded. By default, the image

    <dt>Show thumbnails for unopened images</dt>
    <dd>
        If enabled, the dialog will retrieve preview thumbnails from
        stored but unopened files. If the file doesn't exist or can't be
        opened, a cross will be shown instead. If disabled, those rows

    </dd>
    <dt id="visible-file-types">Visible file types submenu</dt>

        This is a list of all file types that Quick Export can export to.
        Here you can select a subset of these to show in the <a href="#export-file-type">file type
        dropdown</a> on each export settings row. By default, only .jpg, .jpeg
